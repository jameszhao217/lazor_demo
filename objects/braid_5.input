# This is a comment
# This example is for braid 5 in Lazor
#   x = no block allowed
#   o = blocks allowed
#   A = fixed reflect block
#   B = fixed opaque block
#   C = fixed refract block

# Grid will start at top left being 0, 0
# Step size is by half blocks
# Thus, this leads to even numbers indicating
# the rows/columns between blocks, and odd numbers
# intersecting blocks.

# Here we specify that we have 5 reflect blocks
A 5

# Now we specify that we have two lazers
#    x, y, vx, vy
# NOTE! because 0, 0 is the top left, our axis
# are as follows:
#
#      .
#     / \ -y
#      |

#      |_________\ +x

L 3 4 1 1
L 3 6 1 -1

# Here we have the points that we need the lazers to intersect
